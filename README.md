üéÆ ‚å®Ô∏è  Typescript Gamepad and Keyboard handler consolidated into a tiny, easy-to-use npm package
</p>

<h2>About</h2>

Built and used in production for [Oogy: Can You Help](https://oogycanyouhelp.com), an indie deckbuilding adventure on Steam (PC and Mac).

The goal of this project is to provide a useful abstraction over both the [Web Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/Using_the_Gamepad_API) and window-level [KeyboardEvents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent).

Why? In this case, as a video game, we want to handle keyboard and controller input with consistency‚Äîparticularly in special cases such as pause menu input, "on controller disconnected", and Steam Overlay handling.

<h2>Installation</h2>

Once published, should be as simple as:

```bash
npm install -s oogy-controller-manager
```

And using:

```
import { OogyControllerManager } from 'oogy-controller-manager';
```

<h2>Building</h2>

Clone the repository, and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will generate the latest production-ready `.js` file using webpack, located at `dist/OogyControllerManager.js`.

To build with inline sourcemaps, use the `npm run dev` command. See `package.json` for details.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

```ts
/**
 * Represents an "event listener", primarily used to remove that listener
 when moving to a different screen. Has an automatically generated UUID,
 as well as a `deactivated` property, so may be helpful in order to detect
 if a current listener exists in a more complex context.
*/
currentControllerListener: OogyControllerListener;

controllerManager: OogyControllerManager;

constructor() {
  this.controllerManager = new OogyControllerManager({
    onControllerDisconnected: () => {
      this.handleUserPausedGame();
      // if the controller is disconnected, simulate pause event
    }
  });

  this.controllerManager.start(); // start receiving events

  this.controllerManager.addRightClickListener({
    // do the same with right clicking as pressing pause button, globally
    onRightClick: () => {
      this.handleUserPausedGameToggled();
      // not same as `handleUserPausedGame`, as disconnect ALWAYS pauses,
      // this can UNPAUSE as well
    }
  });

  // click event firing can be disabled using the manager-level property:
  // (this is what I use when the Steam Overlay is activated as well)
  // this.controllerManager.shouldStopAcceptingClicks = true;
}
```

<h3>Basic Usage</h3>

```ts
startUserInteraction(): void {

  // in this example, we are on a hypothetical screen with several "cards".
  // as we move on the keyboard or gamepad, we want to highlight the next card,
  // until eventually, we press A to select a card

  this.cardIndex = 0;
  this.cards = [{}, {}, {}]; // example UI elements, most likely,
  // that we are navigating with keyboard or controller

  this.currentControllerListener = this.controllerManager.addListener({
    onControllerInput: (input) => {
      // here is where you may want to interrupt if you did not get a chance
      // to either (1) remove or (2) deactivate the listener beforehand,
      // or as a safeguard in case the screen is inactive but listener
      // was not removed (yet) for some reason.
      // example: if (this.suppressUserInteraction === true) {
      //            return;
      //          }
      // note: this is not for pausing; see blocking listeners
      // for handling pause (`handleUserPausedGame`)

      switch (input) {
        default:
          return;
        case OogyControllerInput.start:
          this.handleUserPausedGameToggled();
          // here is our 3rd path to pausing the game so far,
          // and why this library can be helpful instead of doing this by hand
          break;
        case OogyControllerInput.a:
          this.handleUserSelectedCard(this.cardIndex);
          // SELECT the currently highlighted card so we can trigger any action, etc
          break;
        case OogyControllerInput.right:
          this.highlightedCardIndex = this.highlightedCardIndex + 1;
          // go to the next index -> move one to the right
          if (this.highlightedCardIndex > this.cards.length - 1) {
            this.highlightedCardIndex = 0; // wrap to start if already at end of list
          }
          break;
        // .....
      }
    }
  });
}
```

<h3>Disconnecting</h3>

```ts
stopUserInteraction(): void {
  this.controllerManager.removeListener(
    this.currentControllerListener
  ); // this is all we need to do
  // (each listener has an automagically generated UUID)
}
```

<h3>Blocking Listeners</h3>

```ts
startNavigationBarBlockingListener(): void {

  // in this example, we are entering a context where we need a "blocking"
  // listener, that can intercept and get all keyboard/controller events
  // without disrupting any existing listeners (such as, when PAUSE is active)

  this.controllerManager.addBlockingListener({

    // this is a special kind of listener that does not require a UUID,
    // as the API only supports 1 blocking listener at a time
    // (which is also its whole purpose, anything more complicated should
    //  remove listeners or use the `deactivated` property...)
    interceptControllerInputAndBlock: (input) => {

      if (
        input !== OogyControllerInput.guide &&
        input !== OogyControllerInput.start
      ) {

        if (this.userPausedGame === true) {
          // start is "active" so block anything else from receiving this
          // input until start pressed again
          this.handleInputWhileGamePaused(input);
          return true;
        }

        return false; // not paused, so return `false` to NOT intercept
      }

      this.handleUserPausedGameToggled();
      return true;
      // return `true` to intercept, this is the guide or pause button
    }

  });
}

stopNavigationBarBlockingListener(): void {
  this.controllerManager.removeBlockingListener();
  // no uuid, so this removes the only blocking listener active
}
```
